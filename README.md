## Scatter Plots

People often confuse correlation with causation. Scatter plots contribute in a way, because we often think of the x variable as independent and the y variable as dependent. Here are a few solutions:

- Use [diamond plots](arvix.org/abs/1809.09328)
- Use [weighted pivot scatter plots](pudding.cool)
